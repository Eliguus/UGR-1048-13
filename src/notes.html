<h1>Digestion of lipids</h1>
<h3>Digestion in mouth</h3>

<div class='center'>   
<p>&#8594 There is no digestion of fats in the mouth-even though lingual lipase is available.</p>
<p>&#8594 The pH optima of lingual lipase is on the acidic side, therefore, its activity is mainly in the stomach</p>
<p>&#8594 Is secreted from Ebner's glands of the tongue</p>
<p>&#8594 It hydrolyze short-chain fatty acids at C1/C3 of glycerol</p>
<p>&#8594 Therefore, it is able to digest the fats in cow's milk, butter, ghee and coconut oil.</p>
<p>&#8594 It may hydrolyze 30% of dietary triacylglycerols</p>
    
  </div>
<h4>Gastric lipase</h4>

    
<p>&#8594It has an important role in the milk fat digestion in the stomach of infants.</p>
<p>&#8594 B/c the pH of stomach in infants is not as acidic as in adults.</p>
<p>&#8594The presence of fat in stomach stimulates secretion of enterogasterone hormone.</p>
<p>&#8594 which delays the gastric emptying time of food.</p>
<p>&#8594The longer stay of food in the stomach gives the characteristic high satiety value</p>
    
<h3>Digestion in small Intestine</h3>

<p>&#8594Digestion of lipids begins in the duodenum, when the entrance of the acid chyme from the stomach stimulates the secretion of enteric hormones (small peptides) by the
duodenal mucosa.</p>
<p>&#8594Gastric HCl stimulates the secretion of secretin that promotes the release of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-rich juice from the pancreas into the duodenum via the pancreatic duct.</p>
<p>&#8594Presence of fat in small intestine stimulate the release of cholecystokinin from intestinal mucosa to the blood to induce the release of zymogen granules from the pancreas and the contraction of the gall bladder to release of bile.</p>
